# Jaal Mesh Processing Library

Jaal is a mesh processing library for generation and analysis of Triangular, Quadrilateral, Tetrahedral,
and Hexhedral meshes. 

## Design:
* It is based on C++17 with new features. We try to keep the latest features of the language if they simplify development and maintainiblity of the codes.

* We will use extensivley TBB for multi-threading. 

* Automatic garbage collection using unique and shared pointers.

* Tutorials are given in "Jupyter Notebook" using C++ bindings.

## Dependencies:

*  TBB 
*  Eigen 
*  ANN 
*  Triangle
*  TetGen
*  LibIGL
*  Cork
*  Wyobi
